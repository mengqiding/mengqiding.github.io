excerpt: 'Online review platforms often present reviews from both critics and general users. In this research, 
the authors propose a measure called “topic consistency” to capture the degree of overlap between 
critic and user review content. High topic consistency suggests greater information recall due to 
repeated presentation of the same topics, which may increase the memorability of movie attributes 
and therefore positively affect movie demand. The authors measure the topic consistency between 
critic and user reviews using topic models and further study the financial consequences of this 
measure using data for movies released in the United States. Topic consistency is positively associated 
with subsequent box office revenue, suggesting a positive relationship between topic consistency and 
movie demand. Furthermore, the effect of topic consistency on demand is the greatest for movies with 
mediocre review ratings and when the review ratings from critics are close to those from users. Using 
lab experiments, the authors provide evidence of the causal link between topic consistency and 
consumers’ willingness to watch a movie, and support for the potential mediation through the 
information recall of reviews. Movie producers and advertisers should consider highlighting or 
inducing a central theme for critics and users to discuss, as the more the review content of critics and 
users overlaps, the higher a movie’s revenue.'
